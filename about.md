This is a place for me to share my love for computers and software.

## History

This blog was originally built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) 
and hosted on GitHub Pages somewhere in 2015. Since then I've migrated
the blog to my personal DigitalOcean VPS and  used a couple different 
static site generators, finally settling on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) 
on 7th Jan, 2017.

After having my fair share of issues with Hugo, and not having the time
to host my sites myself, I've *FINALLY* migrated back to Jekyll and 
hosting my site from Github pages ([repo](https://github.com/oxalorg/computableverse.com))
